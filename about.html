  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I was born in Iran and came to Canada in 1995. I got a Mathematics degree
    from the University of Waterloo and did several internships before landing
    at Facebook in 2016.
    <br/><br/>
    I like creating positive experiences through my passion for coding,
    improving my mental and physical performance, and engaging in meaningful
    relationships.
    <br/><br/>
    Welcome to my public diary where I occasionally write about those things.
