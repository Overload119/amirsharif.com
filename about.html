  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    BMath at University of Waterloo.
    Multiple internship experiences in Waterloo, and Silicon Valley.
    These days I help build Facebook's Marketplace.
    <br/><br/>
    I like creating positive experiences through my passion for coding,
    improving my mental and physical performance, and having meaningful
    relationships.
    <br/><br/>
    Welcome to my public diary where I occasionally write about those things.
