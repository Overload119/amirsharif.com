    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>I like to think that my path to programming is a rather interesting one, and I've always wanted to write it down somewhere.</p>
    <p>Since programming has become such a big part of who I am, this story is not only how I found my love for writing code, but pretty much my life story.</p>
    <p>You're thinking: am I going to have to read through all this banter?</p>
    <p>The answer is no.</p>
    <p>My professional resume is located <a href="/resume">here</a>.</p>
    <p>It's pretty much the TLDR.</p>
    <p>This section of the site is for me to let loose and give a raw outline of who I am. It's time to get personal, <b>not</b> professional.</p>
    <p>So let's get started.</p>

    <hr class="small">

    <p>One of the earliest memories I have is of me walking through Zellers with my dad and looking at the games on the shelf.</p>
    <img src="/img/warcraft.jpg">
    <p>What you see above is what I saw on that fateful day, that sparked my fascination with computers.</p>
    <p>To give you an idea of how long ago this was, it was back when games (like Warcraft: Orcs and Humans) looked like this:</p>
    <img src="/img/warcraft_screenshot.jpg">

    <p>So naturally I played that game to death -- to the point where my parents would yell at me and take the computer away.</p>
    <p>And boy would I get angry when they did that. Kicking and screaming is an understatement. I was a 7 year old who had already commanded armies to kill thousands of Orcs--I wasn't going to be bossed around. I would straight up attack my mom. (not my dad though because he'd kick my ass)</p>
    <p>It got so bad that she use to lock me in the basement until I had calmed down. I'd scream "I hate you, I hate you!" over and over again.</p>
    <p>But if anything Warcraft had taught me, it was how to strategize. I was a pretty smart kid and I'd start exploiting my mom's discipline.</p>
    <p>I would quiet down in the basement and my mom would come in and check on me, thinking I had calmed down. I'd be there sitting with a regretful look on my face.</p>
    <p>"I'm so sorry Mom. I love you. I can't believe I got so angry over a stupid game."</p>
    <p>It was all an act though. I just wanted to play that damn game and I figured if I play nice, I can get her to let me play again.</p>
    <p>"Can you find it in your heart to let me play for one more hour?" I'd say.</p>
    <p>My mom was too smart though -- she'd say no.</p>
    <p>"I HATE YOU! I WAS JUST KIDDING WHEN I SAID I LOVED YOU, I HATE YOU! RAAWWWWWWW"</p>
    <p>The door would shut, and I found myself in the basement again.</p>

    <hr class="small">

    <p>This obsession with games sets the stage for the rest of my life.</p>
    <p>Along the way I met Liam, a kid at school who later became one of my best friends.</p>
    <p>I'd go to his house after school and we'd play video games. His dad was a programmer, so he was a lot more liberal with letting his kids play video games compared to my parents.</p>
    <p>At this point my parents thought that games corrupt the youth and would rarely let me play. My parents would never buy me games either -- I'd ask Liam to burn copies of all the game he gets so I can play them at home.</p>
    <p>Things were all fine and dandy, but Liam was always better than me at every game we played.</p>
    <p>I'd be in awe at how fast he would pickup a new game and master it like nothing.</p>
    <p>He had the raw skill, but I was determined to beat him -- my competitive nature came out and I began to strategize the way I did when my mom use to lock me in the basement</p>

    <hr class="small">

    <p>I went into the dark zone. I started hacking. Yup, I was one of those kids that'd use Cheat Engine to edit game memory values. Anything from duping items to changing high scores.</p>
    <p>I didn't care though. I just wanted to be better than Liam. I'd even photoshop pictures of the stats of my character on Diablo II so that they'd be super high and then send it to all my friends. Suck on that.</p>
    <p>But perhaps more importantly, I became fascinated with the world of hacking.</p>    
    <p>How the hell did some guy create a program that breaks into the game code and changes values around?</p>
    <p>I wanted to find out. And so I started looking at the source code for these hacks, trying to teach myself code along the way.</p>
    <p>I broke 2 computers during the process -- sometimes it's hard to tell a hack and a virus apart. My parents were not pleased.</p>

    <hr class="small">

    <p>I learned a lot about how the hacks would work, but even more about the game engines themselves. Around the same time, my cousin had been making animations with Flash 4.</p>
    <img src="/img/flash.png">

    <p>I was always an artistic kid, so I'd start making animations as well. Then I found out you can actually add little scripts to make animations interactive.</p>
    <p>I did this for a while, and eventually got good at it. Flash games started popping up all around the Internet, and I became a regular visitor of <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds.com</a></p>
    <p>I used the knowledge I learned from hacking and started creating my own games in Flash.</p>
    <p>They were crap. I would submit them to Newgrounds.com and they'd get downvoted to hell. They never even made it through the website's community.</p>
    <p>But I kept at it -- because I was determined as ever and I loved the idea of creating something and bringing it to life. I'd create all the assets and code myself.</p>
    <p>Eventually some of my submissions <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/500644">got in.</a></p>
    <p>It was a proud moment.</p>
    <p>The thing that got me the most was that for the first time people were complimenting me about my work.</p>
    <p>It was a great feeling, increased the size of my e-penis and made me want to do bigger and better things.</p>

    <hr class="small">

    <p>I started playing a game called Warcraft III.</p>
    <p>But I noticed that every single game I played just inspired me to make something better.</p>
    <p>I always thought "Wow this game is great, but I wonder what would happen if I did this..."</p>
    <p>Warcraft III had a really big modding community. I started modding and creating levels and submitting it to the community.</p>
    <p>I spent an entire summer on an RPG game called <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/maps-564/cavern-chaos-0-12c-158955/">Caverns of Chaos</a> that got over 6000 downloads, plus tens of thousands more via Battle.NET</p>
    <p>I'd login to the game and people would send me messages, "Woah I love your game!"</p>
    <p>Awesome! I still feel all nice and glowy inside when I think about those days.</p>
    <p>All the feedback I got would be written down in a little journal and I'd work with the community to continue improving the game. Along the way I would create tutorials and give back to the community that helped me on the way up.</p>
    <p>I tinkered around a bit with 3Ds Max 9 and Photoshop, creating textures and models. Below is some of that stuff:</p>

    <hr class="small">

    <p>And then came real life. As highschool was coming to an end I had to start making a decision on what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>
    <p>The realities of game development scared me.</p>
    <p>It was difficult, long hours, mediocre pay, incredibly competitive and I just didn't like that fact that I'd likely be working on someone else's game -- not my own.</p>
    <p>But I found out something very important about myself</p>
    <p>I'm intrigued by challenges, I'm obsessive over what I enjoy doing and I love to make something people love</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuYeHPFR3f0">Pokemon theme song</a> really speaks to me. I want to be the very best, that no one ever was.</p>

    <hr class="small">

    <p>I started building applications that addressed actual needs. The ability for non-technical users to rip music off their favourite websites. Helping people find the cheapest prices for groceries. Allowing individuals to manage their time more effectively.</p>
    <p>I found that through building useful applications I got the same enjoyment as I was when I was making games.</p>
    <p>I'd still be getting the same kind of positive feedback, I'd still be tackling challenges, and most importantly I'd still constantly improve.</p>
    
    <hr class="small">

    <p>It's still pretty early in my web development career but I've been growing my skills as fast as I can.</p>
    <p>I've always wanted to impress people in everything I do, and I like going down a path where I can continue doing that.</p>
    <p>It's hard to think where I'd be today without looking back on how I got here.</p>
    <p>I've come a long way since being locked in a basement.</p>
