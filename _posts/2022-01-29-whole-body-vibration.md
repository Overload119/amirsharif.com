I was walking in a Costco and came across a sales demo of a platform that a guy was standing on called the Power Board. In fact, this demo is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKVb8e2DWA0).  Years before I tried the [Rumble](https://shop.bulletproof.com/products/whole-body-vibration-plate) at a Bulletproof coffee shop which I thought was cool but the $1495 price tag rubbed me off. These devices all aim to provide "Whole Body Vibration" (WBV) and purport the following benefits:

- Stimulate microcirculation
- Strengthen muscles ＆ bones
- Recover after workouts
- Improve mental acuity

I set out on PubMed to figure out what to make of all this.

__tl;dr__: Seems legit. Buy a vibration platform. I bought the [Rumblex 4D Vibration Plate](https://lifeprofitness.com/products/lifepro-rumblex-4d-vibration-plate-exercise-machine-2) after reading the specifications from the studies below and I'm happy with it. 

[Whole-Body-Vibration Training and Balance in Recreational Athletes With Chronic Ankle Instability - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29569943/)
- After 6 weeks of training, improvements on the Biodex Balance System occurred only on the Overall Stability Index ( P = .01) and Anterior-Posterior Stability Index ( P = .03) in the VIB group.
- No change in body composition for any groups.

[Effect of adding whole-body vibration training to squat training on physical function and muscle strength in individuals with knee osteoarthritis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31475941/)
- 41 participants
- Device Used: Sport Platform, i-vib5050, BODYGREEN
- Vibration Parameters: 20Hz, 2mm Amplitude, vertical vibration
- Adding 8 weeks of WBV training to ST can more effectively improve the muscular strength of knee extensors compared with ST in patients with KOA.

[Acute Response of Sclerostin to Whole-body Vibration with Blood Flow Restriction - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33975366/)
- Device Used: Power Plate NEXT generation
- Vibration Parameters: 30Hz, 2mm Amplitude, vertical vibration
- These findings suggest that a single session of whole-body vibration combined with blood flow restriction does not significantly affect serum sclerostin or bone turnover biomarkers.

[Effects of real and sham whole‐body mechanical vibration on spinal excitability at rest and during muscle contraction - Hortobágyi - 2014 - Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.12219)
- Device Used: Model Wave Pro
- Vibration Parameters: 30Hz/50Hz, 2mm Amplitude, vertical vibration
- In summary, real and sham WBV had no effect on specific reflex measured during muscle contraction. Real WBV produced ∼45% depression of the [H-reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-reflex) at rest that recovered slowly during the 1-min long inter-bout rest intervals with the depression further diminishing across the five bouts. The depression converted to 27% and 7% facilitation over the 15-min long recovery period following real WBV at 30 and 50 Hz, respectively
- This study is overall bearish on the effects. I don't know enough about spinal excitability, but one of the purported MOA is the spinal excitability and this study shows there is a depression in that. 

**Other Quotes**

> WBV affects muscles closest to the vibrating surface because of the dissipation of energy in tissues located more proximally.

> For example, WBV at 30 Hz produces 30 stretch-shortening cycles in the agonist and antagonist muscles close to the vibrating platform, i.e., plantar- and dorsiflexors, depolarizing the Ia afferents, exciting the motoneurons, and, in a few cases, the reflex activation is proposed to increase maximal voluntary force and jumping performance after WBV treatments.

[Whole body vibration improves symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32507132/)
- Device Used: Turbosonic, TT2590
- Vibration Parameters: 25Hz
- 20 participants
- Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is characterized by sporadic numbness and frequently debilitating pain in the periphery elicited by hyperglycemia-induced damage to the primary afferent nociceptors leading to hyperexcitability in the central neurons and generation of spontaneous nerve impulses in the periphery (Veves et al., 2008; Schmader, 2002)
- WBV is effective for reducing DPN-associated pain over a two- and four-week interval. This was the first study to demonstrate this using a sham vibration control. We further saw a persistence in pain reduction beyond the day of treatment, indicating a potential chronic effect of WBV treatment.
- Subjects stood with knees slightly flexed: 3 sessions/week, 12min/session, 4 bouts of 3m.

[Adding Whole-Body Vibration to Preconditioning Squat Exercise Increases Cycling Sprint Performance - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28902116/)
- Device Used: BREMSHEY Trainer SE7
- Vibration Parameters: 40Hz, 2mm
- In conclusion, it is plausible to suggest that body-loaded half-squats with WBV acutely induce higher power output levels. The practical application of the current study is that body-loaded squats with WBV can be incorporated into preparations for specific sprint training to improve the quality of the sprint training and also to improve sprint performance in relevant competitions.

[The effects of passive warm-up vs. whole-body vibration on high-intensity performance during sprint cycle exercise - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22293678/)
- Device Used: FitVibe
- Vibration Parameters: 45Hz, 2mm
- Peak power, relative power, relative work, time of peak power, and pedaling cadence were significantly higher in the WBV compared with that for C (p < 0.05)

[Whole-body vibration decreases delayed onset muscle soreness following eccentric exercise in elite hockey players: a randomised controlled trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34641941/)
- Device Used: PowerPlate
- Vibration Parameters: 30Hz, 4mm
- Post-exercise WBV is effective in elite hockey players to reduce DOMS after eccentric exercise. Elite athletes in multi-sprint sports are at risk of DOMS during training and competition, and its reduction could contribute to reduced injury risk and improved performance.

[Effects of whole-body vibration training on calf muscle function during maximal isometric voluntary contractions - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33559944/)
- Device Used: FitVibe
- Vibration Parameters: 30Hz-45Hz, 2-4mm
- Six weeks of WBVT in young, healthy adults increased isometric plantarflexion strength at multiple joint angles, without detectible changes in EMG, muscle architecture, or body composition. Therefore, WBVT can significantly improve maximum plantar flexor strength at multiple joint angles (muscle lengths) in young healthy men, although the mechanisms underpinning the changes are currently unclear.

[Whole-Body Vibration Combined with Treadmill Training Improves Walking Performance in Post-Stroke Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29031023/)
- Device Used: Galileo
- Vibration Parameters: 30Hz, 3mm
- Significant improvements were also seen in walking speed, step length, stride length, and double-limb support compared with the TT (Treadmill Training) group (p<0.05). These findings indicate that WBV-TT is more effective than TT for improving walking performance of patients with chronic stroke.

[Whole-body vibration and stretching enhances dorsiflexion range of motion in individuals with chronic ankle instability - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32325415/)
- Device Used: Dynatronics
- Vibration Parameters: 34Hz, 1.8mm
- Static stretching with WBV increases DFROM (increase dorsiflexion ROM) in participants with CAI (Chronic Ankle Instability) more effectively than static stretching alone.

[Effects of whole-body vibration training in patients with multiple sclerosis: A systematic review - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27448520/)
- This study was an analysis of lots of other studies. 
- Some studies found improvements in muscle strength, functional capacity, coordination, resistance, balance, and some areas of MSSS-88. However, we identified limitations in some of these studies and there are still few publications on vibration training and multiple sclerosis to ensure training effectiveness.

## Mechanism of Action
How does shaking the body end up being beneficial? Not totally clear. 

"It is assumed that Mechanical stimuli are transmitted to the body and stimulate primary endings of muscle spindles. The spindles then activate &-motor neurons, resulting in muscle contractions comparable with the tonic vibration reflex which seems to cause an activation of the muscle fibres that were previously inactive, as demonstrated by surface electromyography (EMG) signals."

## What are people saying?

A big influence on my purchasing decision was just reading the reviews and YT comments. A search on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=whole+body+vibration) shows people just raving about this. This is true across different device types and videos so it's less likely it's promotional stuff.

## Okay, I got one, now what?

The best way to consistently use the device is to find a way to incorporate it into your routines. I've basically augmented my morning routine with some basic stretches that can be done on the machine. Since I weight-train, I'm less interested in using it to build muscle but those programs are a search away.

I reviewed a bunch of different programs and I like this one by [Dr. Yoni Whitten](https://youtu.be/-SGvnYXH3mk?t=112):

1. Rocking Side to Side / Front to Back
2. 15x Spinal Side Bends
3. 15x Spinal Twisting
4. 15x Neck Side Bends
5. 15x Neck Rotations
6. 15x Hip Shifts
7. 30-60s Deep Squat and Twist
8. Stand Nice And Tall
