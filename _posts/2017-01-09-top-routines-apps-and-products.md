## Routines

- Journaling once a week. I send an email to myself that summarizes my week and have a Gmail filter to label and skip the inbox.
- Sauna twice a week, usually Wednesday and once during the weekend.
- I setup monthly goals as a note in Google Keep and then pin them for that month.

### Morning Ritual

- 2 tablespoons of flax seeds with water.
- Some short stretching or movement to get blood circulating.
- Practice my brain games. I'm currently using [Neuronation](https://www.neuronation.com/). Whenever starting a new experiment, I'll keep an eye on my scores here.
- [Deprecated] [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) to review my reading from the previous day.

### Night Ritual

- Apply lavender oil[^1] to wrist, or under nose.
- I stretch with my partner for 10-15 minutes. We generally use this [routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99uYEteT-UI).
- If I'm not tired, I'll lay on my [acupressure mat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049Q0P9M).
