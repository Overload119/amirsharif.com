## Routines

- A "digest" journal I write once a week. I send an email to myself that summarizes my week and have a Gmail filter to label and skip the inbox.
- Sauna twice a week, usually Wednesday and once during the weekend.
- Every month I setup goals and/or things I want to accomplish for that month. I write this on my whiteboard. Most of my goals are "system" oriented that require a daily habit that I measure at the end of each day.
- Sudarshan Kriya as a meditation practice.

### Morning Ritual

- On certain days, I'll drink coffee (Bulletproof beans) with MCT Oil, L-Theanine, and Ashwaganda Power. This seems to be the most effective "nootropic" blend for me.

_Change Log_

June 30 2019

- Added coffee.
- Removed [Neuronation](https://www.neuronation.com/) - not convinced of its benefits.
- Removed [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) - too much upkeep to keep it working.

### Night Ritual

- Stretching[^2]
- Apply lavender oil[^1] to wrist, or under nose.
- If I'm not tired, I'll lay on my [acupressure mat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049Q0P9M).
