## Routines

- A "digest" journal I write once a week. I send an email to myself that summarizes my week and have a Gmail filter to label and skip the inbox.
- Sauna twice a week, usually Wednesday and once during the weekend.
- Every month I setup goals and/or things I want to accomplish for that month. I write this on my whiteboard. Most of my goals are "system" oriented that require a daily habit that I measure at the end of each day.
- Sudarshan Kriya as a meditation practice.

### Morning Ritual

- Stretching[^2]
- Practice my brain games. I'm currently using [Neuronation](https://www.neuronation.com/). Whenever starting a new experiment, I'll keep an eye on my scores here.
- [Deprecated] [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) to review my reading from the previous day.

### Night Ritual

- Stretching[^2]
- Apply lavender oil[^1] to wrist, or under nose.
- If I'm not tired, I'll lay on my [acupressure mat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049Q0P9M).
