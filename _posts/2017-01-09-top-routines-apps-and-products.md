# Routines

- Journaling once a week. I send an email to myself that summarizes my week and have a Gmail filter to label and skip the inbox.
- Sauna twice a week, usually Wednesday and once during the weekend.
- I setup monthly goals as a note in Google Keep and then pin them for that month.

## Morning Ritual

- Wash face.
- Brain games. I'm currently using [Neuronation](https://www.neuronation.com/).
- Readwise to review my reading from the previous day.

## Night Ritual

- I stretch with my partner for 10-15 minutes.
- If I'm not tired, I'll lay on my [acupressure mat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049Q0P9M).
