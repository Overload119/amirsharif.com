A summary of the key lessons I learned from reading [Great at Work](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZKB2QT/).

- Do fewer things, and do them well.
- Everything you touch should turn into gold.
- Value of Work = Benefits to Others x Quality x Efficiency.
- You can increase performance up to 50 hours per week. After 65 hour, performance starts to wane.
- Pick one and only one skill to develop at a time.
- Enjoying the work you do comes down to purpose and passion.
  - Purpose: "What can I give the world?"
  - Passion: "What can the world give me?"

Many people prioritize a few items at work, but they don’t obsess—they simply do less. That’s a mistake.
demonstrated through a series of psychological experiments that people cling to options, even when those options no longer provide any value
Find a few techniques that enable you to “tie yourself to the mast,” so that you aren’t prevented from obsessing over key priorities. Ask your boss to prioritize some of your responsibilities so that you understand better where to focus.
The value of a person’s work = Benefits to others × quality × efficiency
The second component of value is the quality of your work—the degree of accuracy, insight, novelty, and reliability of your work output.
The final component of value is how efficiently you work. In the transcription example, productivity was measured through speed—the number of words per minute.

“functional fixedness”—our inability to solve problems due to our fixation on how work has always been
The combination of asking a “stupid” question and crafting some “what-ifs” can help you discover a nifty redesign and lift your performance.
According to our statistical analysis, if you work up to 50 hours, performance improves as you add more hours. Beyond 50 hours, the benefit of adding more hours starts to wane. Beyond 65 hours, adding more hours causes performance to decline.
Individuals who progress the most meticulously assess outcomes, solicit feedback based on known standards of excellence, and strive to correct tiny flaws that the feedback has
Yes, so long as you stick to the Power of One: Pick one and only one skill at a time to develop.
Purpose asks, “What can I give the world?” Passion asks, “What can the world give me?

Passion at work is an expanding circle that encompasses all six areas: joy doing the tasks, excitement at succeeding, the thrill from unleashing one’s creative energy, enthusiasm from being with people at work, delight from learning and growing, and elation from doing one’s job well.
Ask your boss to assign you a stretch goal to challenge yourself. Seek ways to spend more time working with people you like and admire. Avoid colleagues who sap your energy. Identify the most passion-sapping task you have and find a way to get out of it. Seek to become really excellent in one job activity.
Passion is doing what you love; purpose is doing what contributes.

Passion can also come from: success, creativity, social interactions, learning, and competence.
They inspired others by evoking emotions, and they circumvented resistance by deploying “smart grit.”

side—make them mad and fearful about the present, and joyful and excited about your proposed future goal.
The tactics of lining up emotions properly, showing (and not just telling), and making people feel purpose enable you to inspire people so that they will support your efforts. Everyone can use these tactics; you don’t have to have a charismatic personality to inspire colleagues at work.
You also need to tailor your tactics to neutralize opposition from people.
Smart grit involves not only persevering but also taking into account the perspective of people you’re trying to influence and devising tactics that will win them over.

they mustered inspirational tactics and deployed smart grit to overcome opposition.
First, they inspire by evoking emotions in individuals whose support they need. Second, they apply smart grit, tailoring and adjusting their tactics in the face of opposition.
They make people angry about today and excited for tomorrow. • They show and don’t just tell, using striking photos and demos to evoke intense emotions. • They make people feel purpose, connecting daily tedious work to a grander purpose.
They consider the perspective of opponents (“standing in their shoes”), tailoring their tactics to address opponents’ specific concerns and agendas. • They confront opponents, when needed. • They make concessions they can live with to appease opponents. • They co-opt opponents, so that they, too, feel a sense of ownership. • They exert pressure by mobilizing people to advocate on their behalf.
And yet, in a worldwide Microsoft survey of 38,000 people, 69 percent said their meetings weren’t productive.10 A Harris poll of 2,066 employees even found that almost half of respondents would “prefer to do almost anything else instead of sitting in a status meeting.” Would they rather watch paint dry? A full 17 percent said yes.
When teams have a good fight in their meetings, team members debate the issues, consider alternatives, challenge one another, listen to minority views, scrutinize assumptions, and enable every participant to speak up without fear of retribution.
TIPS FOR DEBATING WELL • Present new data: “I pulled some market data from Atlanta that is interesting . . .” • Jot down three questions beforehand (and especially around key assumptions): “Does your number assume that customers will buy additional products?” • Jump into a dissenting role: “For the sake of argument, let me state an alternative point of view . . .” • Build on other viewpoints. (“If we expand your idea to a larger market . . .”) • Change your mind from time to time. Fight for the best idea, not for yours. TIPS FOR LISTENING WELL (so that you can build on what others say) • Don’t interrupt. Let others finish their thoughts (except for that long-winded colleague). • Don’t listen just to prepare your own answer. First listen to understand (a golden nugget from Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits). • Paraphrase what someone else said and check it for accuracy (“Did I get that right?”) • Make eye contact with whoever is speaking. • Don’t snooze. Or doodle. Or cross arms. Even if you are listening, your body language may suggest that you are not. • Ask nonleading questions. Look for the truth, not for confirmation of your views. • Put away that smartphone (multitasking doesn’t work).
Ham would have been better off putting her query this way: “What’s your view on the foam damage?” Or she could have asked, “Does someone have a different point of view?” Or: “Can someone argue the opposite point of view?”
in groups has shown that employees have trouble committing to a decision when they perceive the process as unfair.
Don’t second-guess team decisions that go against your personal interests (avoid that hallway chatter, “I’m not sure we should be doing that . . .”). • Don’t appeal a team decision that conflicts with your personal agenda to higher-ups. Accept it and move on. • Clarify with your boss any conflict that may exist between your individual goals and a team goal (“I can’t spend 100 percent of my time selling insurance when the new team goal requires me to help sell mortgages, too . . .”) • Send an email declaring your support to the team. “I am on board.” • Do one thing—fast—that shows you’re implementing the decision, even if it goes against your interests (“I’ve already set up the meeting with the supplier . . .”) • Confront a colleague who’s playing politics: “We made the decision, stop second-guessing . . . let’s go and do it!”
Yet most people—69 percent according to one study—complain that their meetings aren’t productive. • In our study, many people struggled with two important aspects of team meetings. Some failed to hold rigorous “fights” or debates in which they explored ideas and scrutinized assumptions. Some also failed to commit to decisions once they were made and to work hard to implement them (to unite as a team). In either case, team meetings suffered, and an employee’s individual performance diminished. • To have a productive fight in meetings, pursue the following strategies, either as leader or participant: • Maximize diversity, not talent • Make it safe to speak up • Prod the quiet to speak • Show up as an advocate, not a salesperson • Ask nonleading questions.
Ensure everyone has a voice (being heard creates buy-in) • Commit, especially when you utterly disagree • Confront the prima donna • Sharpen the team goal • Stop playing office politics and get behind decisions.
Sticks in a bundle are unbreakable.
Mike undertook the first, fundamental step in disciplined collaboration: building a clear, rigorous business case.
To be disciplined about collaboration is to say “no” to the wrong opportunities and only select those few that produce compelling value.
What were the opportunity costs? Large: The team could have spent its limited time working on the proposal instead of interacting with the three experts. What were the collaboration costs? Huge: by insisting on different approaches, the experts created conflict. All in all, the outcome was surely a negative collaboration “premium.”
That’s a common goal that could excite each sales force to work toward winning in the market place together.
common, concrete, measurable, and finite.
And so people check the box—“yes, did show up for that committee meeting.” When you reward activities, that’s what you get—lots of collaboration activities.
Reward people for collaboration results, not activities.
How to Apply Trust Boosters Source of Distrust Useful Trust Boosters Lack of competence or resources. You’re not certain your partner has the time, money, or skills to deliver high-quality work by the deadline. Verify (e.g., ask for track record, prior work); Start small (e.g., pilot to test) Insincere intentions. You’re suspicious of your partner’s commitment to the unifying goal. Verify; Start small; Get public commitment (e.g., Mike’s email at Agilent) Misunderstandings. You and your partner may not agree as to what needs to get done, when, and how. Clarify and educate (e.g., Mike at Agilent educating life sciences about the market size) Strangers. You and your partner don’t know one another well, and you come from different backgrounds (departments, functions, education, nationality, etc.) Bond up front (team exercise); Share personal information to get to know each other better
This belief is wrong. The goal of collaboration isn’t collaboration. It’s better performance.
Organizations and employees struggle with twin sins: undercollaboration and overcollaboration. Some people talk too little across teams and departments, and some people talk too much. • To avoid the extremes of too little or too much collaboration, top performers discipline collaboration: they carefully select which collaboration activities to participate in (and reject others), and then follow specific rules to make the chosen activities a success. • In our study, people who practiced disciplined collaboration placed 14 percentage points higher in the performance ranking than people who didn’t. Women benefited more than men. • Disciplined collaboration consists of the following five rules: 1. Establish the business case—a compelling reason—for any proposed collaboration initiative, small or large. If it’s questionable, say no. 2. Craft a unifying goal that excites people, so that they prioritize this project. 3. Reward people for collaboration results, not activities. 4. Commit full resources—time, skills, and money—to the collaboration. If you can’t obtain those resources, narrow its scope or kill it. 5. Tailor trust boosters—quickly—to specific trust problems in the partnership.
We could select very few priorities that maximize value, and then apply intense, targeted effort to master the skills required. We could find and select some work activities that match our passion with a sense of purpose in our work. We could carefully choose a few inspirational and influence tactics to convince others to support our efforts. We could participate in fewer teamwork meetings but foster more intense debates in those meetings we do attend to arrive at better solutions.
It’s to concentrate on working smarter Work on how you work, not on protecting your life from your work.
“Do less, then obsess” can protect people from becoming exhausted at work because it leaves them with fewer priorities to handle and track. Likewise, if you take a more disciplined approach to collaboration, your partnerships enable you to accomplish more in less time, thus preventing exhaustion. Both of these practices prevent you from being physically and mentally exhausted at work.
All of this time-saving piles up. Review your schedule over the past two weeks and remove all the assignments, phone calls, email tasks, and meetings you wouldn’t have had to bother with if you had followed these practices. Chances are, that’s a lot of time! I think of this newfound time as a “time dividend”
In general, as we saw in chapter three, working beyond 50 to 55 hours a week didn’t yield significantly higher performance.
One study of fifty-two staff in a small private hospital in Northern California found that nurses who experienced more unpleasant interactions with colleagues and supervisors were more emotionally exhausted from work and suffered from much higher burnout levels.
Likewise, when other people make disputes personal in a meeting, try to reorient them. One great tactic is to get more objective, highlighting impersonal data, facts, and numbers as opposed to emotion-laden opinions.
Another is to play “devil’s advocate,” a tactic that reduces interpersonal conflict by allowing you to play a role rather than speaking for yourself (“for the sake of argument, I am going to disagree”). Make fights about ideas, not people.
Try to find just one way to reduce the time you spend on activities of little value (like furnishing those reports that no one reads) and to increase an activity that will yield value (returning those customer calls more quickly).
