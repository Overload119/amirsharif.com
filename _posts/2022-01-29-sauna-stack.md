# Sauna Stack

I've been going to the sauna twice a week and I've made a bit of a ritual of it. Below you'll find some of the tools and routines I use before, during, and after the sauna. 

- I take 300mg of Niacin ~1 hour before. Niacin mobilizes fat cells to release toxins into the blood, which causes more of it to sweat out: everything I've read so far suggests it improves your ability to detox from heavy metals, drugs, food preservatives, pesticides, and even plastics. A few studies:
  - [A Detoxification Intervention for Gulf War Illness: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6862571/)
  - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3312275/
  - [Detoxification in Naturopathic Medicine: A Survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3239317/)
  - [Sauna Exposed: What Happens To Your Body After Using A Sauna](https://www.finnleo.com/hubfs/assets/health-benefits-library/general-sauna-benefits/therenegadepharmacist.com-Sauna-Expose-What-Happens-To-Your-Body-After-Using-A-Sauna.pdf)
- I find it helpful to have a bag with all of these things: that way I don't have to pack and prepare it. I just grab my bag and go.
  - Ear plugs (my gym plays annoying music and it's loud enough to hear from the sauna)
  - Shower sandals (for public showers)
  - [Menthol body lotion](https://www.amazon.com/Nutt-Butter-EXTREME-Menthol-Anti-Chafing/dp/B07DMR66T5) - makes you feel cool after.
  - I pack a water bottle with ice and put some [electrolytes](https://amzn.to/3znj3ZN) in it. I fill it with water when I get out of the sauna.
