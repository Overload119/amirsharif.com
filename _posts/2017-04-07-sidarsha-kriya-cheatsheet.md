# Sudarshan Kriya - Cheatsheet

> This month I'm experimenting with Sudarshan Kriya. Below is my cheatsheet for how I'm incorporating it into my routine. It's only been a few days, but having tried [Love and Kindness meditation](http://www.contemplativemind.org/practices/tree/loving-kindness), [Transcendental Meditation](https://www.tm.org), and Mindfulness meditation, I can say that I walk out of my Sudarshan Kriya sessions with a larger effect on wellbeing than other kinds of meditation. For that reason alone, I'm hopeful it'll become a permanent part of my routine.

## Why Sudarshan Kriya?

- 56% reduction in cortisol (stress hormone)
- 218% increase in deep sleep
- 500% increase in lymphocyte count (enhanced immune function)
- 50% increase in prolactine (well-being hormone)
- 70% decrease in remission rate of depression in 1 month.

There are over 70 independent studies (probably more by the time you read this).
You can learn more [here](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/research-sudarshan-kriya) as well as at the bottom of this post where I go through the best studies in my opinion.

## Cheatsheet

This is my personal "rendition" gathered from YouTube and the various research papers on the subject.
The Art of Living organization suggests you pay to have a teacher help you through your practice. I'll leave that up to the reader.
