# Learning Engine

In a newsletter from [Sahil Bloom](https://sahilbloom.substack.com/people/12887102-sahil-bloom), I saw the term "Learning Engine" defined as, "...all the learning “inputs” regularly consumed - books, newsletters, podcasts, videos, etc."

This article summarizes my Learning Engine, and I encourage others to create one. It often helps to learn what inputs are going into other people's worldview so you can better understand them. 

## Books

I keep track of all books I've [read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48435204-amir-sharif?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read), [want to read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48435204-amir-sharif?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read), and [currently reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48435204-amir-sharif?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=currently-reading) on Goodreads.

I use PocketCasts to listen to Podcasts. Here's my current list of podcasts. This requires a manual export on my end, so it may not be up to date.
