## Occasionally

These are the supplements I'll take based on the situation.

### Nicotine

I find nicotine can be just as good of a cognitive booster (if not better) than coffee. I was previously afraid of using nicotine due to it's associating with smoking, but when taken as a lozenge you're bypassing some of the addictive behavior and negative side effects. 

> Preclinical models and human studies have demonstrated that nicotine has cognitive-enhancing effects, including improvement of fine motor functions, attention, working memory, and episodic memory. ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6018192/))

> Nicotine is rightly reviled because of its associations with smoking and addiction. But the rogue substance has a wide range of effects on the brain, which may include some healing properties. Researchers are testing nicotine and related compounds as treatments for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other conditions. ... Nicotine does have some negative cardiovascular effects, raising blood pressure and causing arteries to constrict, but it's debatable how significant they are. [Nicotine: It may have a good side - Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Nicotine_It_may_have_a_good_side)

- Product Recommendation: [Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge, 2 mg (nicotine)](https://amzn.to/2NoQKb6)

### L-Theanine

> L-Theanine is one of the main active ingredients found in green tea, alongside caffeine and green tea catechins. It helps reduce anxiety and promotes relaxation without drowsiness, making it potentially synergistic with caffeine. ([source](https://examine.com/supplements/theanine/))

- Product Recommendation:  [SuntheanineÂ® L-Theanine 200mg](https://amzn.to/2Nkgbe0)
- When I Take It: To relax or calm down or as a cognitive support when combined with coffee. I like it best in the evenings.
